Go to Settings->About Chrome, and check your Chrome Version and download accordingly from
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

After downloading, extract the chromedriver and add the .exe file to the same directory as the main.py.

Or alternatively, you can add the path of chromedriver.exe manually in the code.

Look for the following line in the code.

driver = webdriver.Chrome("//Add Path Here")
